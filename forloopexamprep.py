#hyper simple for loops python

# Define a sequence (in this case, a list)
arr_matey = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] #list is initialized, which isn't really a list
#it is actually an array of INTS. ffs


# Loop over each element in the sequence
for element in arr_matey:
    arr_matey.reverse()
    
    #so, the general syntax for looping over shit is for, array element, 
    #in the array name "stupidly called my list, despite being an arr
    
    # Print each element
#    print("Current element:", element)

# Print after the loop ends
#print("Loop ended.")
#print("reversed array is", arr_matey)

#aiight lets do some reversals and steppin. some shit was commented out here
